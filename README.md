# IcedSubtitleWatcher
View (or watch) subtitle files even when you have no video to accompany it!

# What?
Inspired by vinceman's [subtitle-buddy application](https://github.com/vincemann/subtitle-buddy), I decided that it would be fun to try and recreate it in Iced. It's very rough around the edges, but the basic functionality works. Intentionally only supports .ass/.ssa/.srt files only because of unfinished input metadata sanitization.

# How to run?

```
git clone https://github.com/marischou/IcedSubtitleWatcher.git
cd IcedSubtitleWatcher
cargo run
```
